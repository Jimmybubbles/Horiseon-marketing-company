# Horiseon-marketing-company
code refactor for marketing company

The company site had no semantic element tags only div boxes so they were changed to nav, section, header, foorter

alt attributes were added for readability and search engine functionality.

CSS styling was condensed down and renamed so that the structure was easier to read and more general.
